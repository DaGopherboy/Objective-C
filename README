My workthrough of, Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide by Joe Conway 
& Aaron Hillegass

Though I have yet to complete this book (A little under half way I think), I would 
highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning Objective-C.  Its not 
an easy read by any means, but the amount of code, challenges, and explanations 
help guide you through it effectively.
